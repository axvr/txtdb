# txtql - SQL implementation for txtdb

Yeah, I'm writing a simple SQL compiler for my database engine. Just like with
txtdb itself, this is not designed to be fast or efficient, it is just a
learning project.

It s based on the compiler created in [this screencast](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-compiler-from-scratch)
from [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/).
